# Cloud DTC Pipeline

This repository runs a Docker Compose pipeline for creating, deploying, and
federating digital twins:

```text
Enterprise Architect project or SysML v2 model
  -> SysML profile converter
  -> digital-twin-manager
  -> optional federation and Terraform
  -> optional simulator and Grafana
```

See [PIPELINE_STATE_DIAGRAM.md](PIPELINE_STATE_DIAGRAM.md) for the execution
states.

Generated directories do not need placeholder files. The orchestrator or
Docker Compose creates them when required.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose.
- Python 3.
- AWS credentials for real deploy, destroy, federation Terraform, or
  CloudWatch-backed Grafana.

Several pipeline images are published for `linux/amd64`. The supplied
`.env.example` selects that platform by default.

## Initial Setup

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
Copy-Item pipeline/fed-sysml/input/brokerConfig.example.json pipeline/fed-sysml/input/brokerConfig.json
Copy-Item pipeline/fed-sysml/input/fedtwin.example.json pipeline/fed-sysml/input/fedtwin.json
```

Edit `.env` and the two local federation files as needed. They are ignored and
must never be force-added to Git.

The bundled federation template uses:

```text
ConsumptionStrategy2
PV2.production
Battery2.status
```

The `DTP_PATH_MAP` value in `.env.example` maps a legacy absolute path embedded
in the bundled Enterprise Architect model to
`/pipeline/code/microgrid/stopCharging`. It is a model-path translation, not a
path that must exist on the host.

## Start the Pipeline

```powershell
python run_pipeline.py
```

The orchestrator starts:

- `enterprise-architect`;
- `sysml-kernel`;
- a watcher for `pipeline/enterprise-architect/output`.

Open Enterprise Architect at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:6080
```

Stop the run loop with:

```text
exit
```

Useful launch options:

```powershell
python run_pipeline.py --auto-run
python run_pipeline.py --config path\to\orchestrator_config.json
python run_pipeline.py --remove-infrastructure-on-exit
```

## Enterprise Architect Workflow

The Compose mounts preserve the same directory structure in Wine and on the
host:

| Use            | Wine path                                             | Host path                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Project files  | `C:\users\ea\Documents\enterprise-architect\projects` | `pipeline/enterprise-architect/projects` |
| Import sources | `C:\users\ea\Documents\enterprise-architect\input`    | `pipeline/enterprise-architect/input`    |
| Save exports   | `C:\users\ea\Documents\enterprise-architect\output`   | `pipeline/enterprise-architect/output`   |

Open a tracked `.qea` or `.qeax` project and export `.xml`, `.xmi`, or `.sysml`
into the output directory. The watcher detects the export and asks whether to
run the matching converter.

| Export         | Converter                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `.xml`, `.xmi` | `digital-twin-profile-sysml-v1` |
| `.sysml`       | `digital-twin-profile-sysml-v2` |

EA exports are generated artifacts. Do not commit files from
`pipeline/enterprise-architect/output`.

## Direct SysML v2 Workflow

Tracked SysML v2 models live in:

```text
pipeline/digital-twin-profile-sysml-v2/input
```

Run a selected model from the active orchestrator:

```text
continue sysml-v2 Battery2.sysml
continue sysml-v2 CoffeeMachine.sysml
continue sysml-v2 dtc-s-pv.sysml
```

`CoffeeMachine.sysml` references the four deployable actuator handlers under
`demo-code/coffee-machine`. The handlers return `command` and `reason`; the
model forwards that action result to the target actuator through MQTT feedback.

The orchestrator copies the selected file to the ignored `run-input` directory,
runs the v2 converter, and stages the generated manager configs.

`dtc-s-pv.sysml` references
`demo-code/microgrid/pv/pv-to-battery-push`. Its Lambda file is a source
template: the battery virtual sensor ID must be injected during deployment
preparation. The placeholder deliberately raises an error if the injection did
not happen, and the generated ID must not be committed.

## Generated Data Flow

| Source                       | Generated local state                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EA export                    | `digital-twin-profile-sysml-v1/input` and `output`            |
| SysML v2 model               | `digital-twin-profile-sysml-v2/run-input` and `output`        |
| Converter output             | `digital-twin-manager/input`                                  |
| Manager input                | `digital-twin-manager/deployments/<Twin>/input`               |
| Manager deploy               | `digital-twin-manager/output` and `deployments/<Twin>/output` |
| Manager plan/apply           | Redeployment state in the matching manager output snapshot   |
| Saved manager outputs        | `fed-sysml/input/strategyInputs`                              |
| Federation config and inputs | `fed-sysml/output`                                            |

Manager deployment output can contain IoT private keys, redeployment state, and
saved plans. Federation output can contain Terraform state, plans, downloaded
providers, account identifiers, and Lambda archives. All of these paths are
ignored.

## Interactive Commands

Type commands in the terminal running `python run_pipeline.py`.

| Command                                | Purpose                                             |

| `stop grafana`                         | Stop local Grafana.                                 |
| `exit`                                 | Stop the watcher.                                   |

## Deploy, Update, and Federate

After conversion, manager configs are available locally in:

```text
pipeline/digital-twin-manager/input
pipeline/digital-twin-manager/deployments/<Twin>/input
```

Deploy or destroy a saved twin:

```text
continue digital-twin-manager Battery2
destroy digital-twin-manager Battery2
```

After changing and regenerating the input for an already deployed twin, create
and apply a redeployment plan:

```text
plan digital-twin-manager Battery2
apply digital-twin-manager Battery2
```

The plan and last-applied manager state are kept under the selected twin's
`deployments/<Twin>/output/.digital-twin-manager-state` snapshot. `apply`
requires a successful `plan` for the same twin and asks for confirmation before
changing AWS resources.

Older deployment snapshots without this state must first be initialized with
the manager's `init-state` command while using the unchanged deployed config.

Before federation, deploy or update every twin referenced by the local
`pipeline/fed-sysml/input/fedtwin.json`, then run:

```text
continue fed-sysml
```

Terraform output is generated under `pipeline/fed-sysml/output`. Use the
interactive Terraform commands instead of committing that directory.

## Simulator and Grafana

Start a simulator for a saved deployment:

```text
start simulator Battery2
```

Simulator ports start at `5000`. Runtime state is written to:

```text
pipeline/digital-twin-manager/deployments/<Twin>/simulator.json
```

Start Grafana:

```text
start grafana
```

Default access:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
admin / admin123
```

The Compose service mounts the tracked files from
`pipeline/grafana/provisioning` and `pipeline/grafana/dashboards` read-only.
The bundled dashboard targets `ConsumptionStrategy2` in `eu-west-1`.

## Configuration

The main orchestrator configuration is `orchestrator_config.json`.

| Field                           | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `digital_twin_name`             | Default name passed to the v1 converter.                    |
| `generated_twin_dir`            | Optional converter output directory override.               |
| `path_maps`                     | Maps model paths to container paths under `/pipeline/code`. |
| `clean_stage`                   | Recreates staging/output directories before a run.          |
| `deploy_to_aws`                 | `false` stops before deploy, `true` deploys, `null` asks.   |
| `run_federation_workflow`       | Runs federation after manager deploy.                       |
| `fed_sysml_terraform_action`    | `none`, `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy`.                      |
| `auto_run`                      | Runs detected exports without confirmation.                 |
| `remove_infrastructure_on_exit` | Removes EA and SysML kernel containers on exit.             |
| `watch.directory`               | Directory watched for EA exports.                           |

Docker Compose reads `.env` automatically. Use it for AWS credentials, code
mount overrides, ports, and local service settings.

## Git Policy

Commit source models, source code, reusable templates, tests, documentation,
and service provisioning. Do not commit:

- `.env`, credentials, private keys, or local broker configuration;
- EA exports;
- converter input staging or output;
- manager input/output/deployment snapshots;
- federation strategy staging or generated output;
- Terraform state, plans, providers, or locks generated inside output;
- generated Lambda ZIP archives;
- Python environments, caches, or IDE state.

If a generated file is needed for debugging, keep it local or attach it to an
issue/artifact store instead of force-adding it to the repository.
